# Generate Fibonacci series up to 15 terms

# Have you ever wondered about the Fibonacci Sequence? Itâ€™s a series of numbers 
# in which the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. 
# The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

# For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series is 13 + 21 = 34.

# Expected output:

# Fibonacci sequence:
# 0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55  89  144  233  377

num1 = 0
num2 = 1

for i in range(15):
    print(num1, end= " ")
    result = num1 + num2
    num1 = num2
    num2 = result
