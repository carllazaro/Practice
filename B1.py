# Perform Basic Tuple Operations
# Create a Tuple: Create a tuple named my_tuple containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
# Access Elements: Access and print the third element of my_tuple.
# Tuple Length: Find and print the length of my_tuple.

# My tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# The third element of my_tuple: 3
# The length of my_tuple: 5

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(f"My tuple: {my_tuple}")
print(f"The third element of my_tuple is: {my_tuple[2]}")
print(f"The length of my_tuple is: {len(my_tuple)}")
